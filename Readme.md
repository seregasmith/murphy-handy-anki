# Goal
The main goal of that project is to make it very convenient to use the best methodology to learn and the best English Grammar Exercises content.
[Anki][https://apps.ankiweb.net/#downloads] is the well known tool to learn something day by day. But it's only a hummer. Cards are our needles.
[Murphy's Grammar in Use (Blue)][https://www.cambridge.org/gb/cambridgeenglish/catalog/grammar-vocabulary-and-pronunciation/english-grammar-use-5th-edition] is my treasure to recap grammar knowledge. I do love the book itself and had it in my hands, but it's not handy to use it during my daily travels. 
One day I found another treasure - [Anki Cards for Blue Murphy][https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5310839]. I think the source of it [here][https://vk.com/ankisrs]. I don't think the content itself is legal 
There were some issues with cards. The cards of exercises are not good to solve it from smartphone. Choices - is a string after a question. The only way to answer - type it into input field. It's OK for small answers, but when there's a sentence - you skip typing.
My version - to *create handy buttons* to type it and fill input field. For smartphones we have to input something else by OS Keyboard to register answer for hint check. Known [issue][https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/this-piece-of-javascript-does-not-seem-to-work-hint-button/9627/3], maybe later it will be fixed.

# How to use it
1. Download [apkg][https://disk.yandex.ru/d/mWWeC1OrRvrNLA] and import it in your [app][https://apps.ankiweb.net/#downloads]
2. Set your options to schedule studies on Deck. My opts - 25 new, 50 to recap for Exercises Deck. It's about 30 min a day to solve all scheduled cards.
3. Open Deck and resume your study
	1. When it's no options - fill input according to question and score your answer after hint check.
	2. When only one field you can input answer by keyboard or press a button with the correct answer. When you again press any button after it, all fields would be cleared.
	3. If there are many fields to answer type answers as times as fields' count and if you type it one more - clearing would be happen.
	4. Use CLEAR button to clear all fields and input.
*In case you check and want to submit answer on **mobile**, type something to make a correct hint check. Type a **space** at the end, for example.
